### Weather-App

## By using Html, Css & JavaScript

The Weather App JavaScript project is a website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to give users the latest weather updates for a place they choose. You can type in a location, and it will show you the current weather, like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and if it's raining. It also tells you what the weather will be like in the next few days. This is helpful for travelers, people who love the outdoors, businesses that need to know the weather, and for schools to teach students about weather. Plus, it's a good way for people to practice their JavaScript skills while getting weather info for their plans.
